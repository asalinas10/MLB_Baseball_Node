# baseball-node

In this project I made a basic web server with the use of node.js. The overview page has a list of all MLB teams and when you select a card it directs you to the team page that has their statistics from the previous season.

The data came from baseball-reference.com and imported it into a JSON file

I then used node.js to create the server and team cards.
